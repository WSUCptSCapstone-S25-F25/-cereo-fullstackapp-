## Historical View Filters

Service info modal includes two historical modes:

### Date Range Mode
- Start date input
- End date input
- Apply and Clear actions

Both modes build time range and re-apply raster tile URLs with time parameters.

### Active Indicator
If a service has active time filter, modal shows active filter date interval.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why does applying time filter redraw layers?**
A: Time filter updates tile source URLs, so raster sources are rebuilt with new temporal parameters.

**Q: Why no info appears in modal for some services/layers?**
A: Some ArcGIS endpoints provide limited metadata or return empty fields.
