## What's New (User Facing)
 * Team Inventory - Defined team roles and responsibilities.
 * Project Description and Clarification - Outlined project goals, requirements, and key challenges.
 * Client Report - Documented key takeaways from our first client meeting, including feedback and expectations.
 * Sprint 1 Report - Summarized our progress, challenges, and plans for the next sprint.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team focused on documentation, completing tasks such as the team inventory, project description, client report, and sprint report. Each team member contributed by working on different sections of these documents. We had our first client meeting, where we gained valuable insights into the project's goals and challenges. However, we have only met with one client representative so far, and a follow-up meeting with the full client team is scheduled for the next sprint. Through this process, we have familiarized ourselves with the project requirements and expectations. While we have not yet begun coding, this sprint has laid the groundwork for future development.

## Unfinished Work
Since development has not started yet due to access issues, there were no coding tasks to leave unfinished. The only unfinished documentation work is the Requirements and Specifications Document, which has been moved to the next sprint and is scheduled for completion. Next sprint, we will focus on getting access to the system and starting development.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Our team developed a better understanding of the main issues affecting the Living Atlas and set clear objectives for improvement.
  * We identified a long-term goal of expanding the application's user base beyond WSU, making it accessible to external communities.
  * A follow-up meeting with the client was scheduled for February 3rd to address remaining questions and next steps.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Start the development process earlier in future sprints so that we have technical progress and issues to report.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Investigate and fix performance issues to improve the application’s stability and reliability.
   * Develop a system to allow authorized users to contribute data to the map, including image uploads.
   * Work on redesigning or improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
